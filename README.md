CodeSoft Internship Projects

Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Create a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual data. Explore techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, and implement classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to achieve the task.
Dataset: Provided by CodeSoft via Kaggle.


Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Design a model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset with transaction details. Experiment with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
Dataset: Provided by CodeSoft via Kaggle.


Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Develop a predictive model to determine customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Utilize historical customer data, including features such as usage behavior and customer demographics. Consider algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to enhance prediction accuracy.
Dataset: Provided by CodeSoft via Kaggle.


Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
Build an AI-powered model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings and apply classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines for spam detection.
Dataset: Provided by CodeSoft via Kaggle.
